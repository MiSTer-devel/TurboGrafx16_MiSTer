# TurboGrafx 16 / PC Engine for [MiSTer Board](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) 

### This is the port of Gregory Estrade's [FPGAPCE](https://github.com/Torlus/FPGAPCE)

## Features
 * SuperGrafx mode
 * Support saves
 * Completely rewritten CPU and VDC for cycle accuracy
 * Uses DDR3 and SDRAM for cartridge's ROM (SDRAM is recommended for accuracy)
 * 6(8)-buttons joystick support
 * Turbotap(multiple joysticks)
 * Support for Street Fighter II and Populous mappers
 * Support CD-ROM games
 * Support Arcade Card games
 * Cheat engine

## Installation:
Copy the *.rbf file at the root of the SD card. Copy roms (*PCE,*BIN) to **TGFX16** folder. You may rename ROM of your favorite game to **boot.rom** - it will be automatically loaded upon core loading.
Use SGX file extension for SuperGrafx games.

## CD-ROM games
CD-ROM images must be in BIN/CUE format, and must be located in the **TGFX16-CD** folder. Each CD-ROM image must have its own folder.
**cd_bios.rom** must be placed in the same TGFX16-CD folder as the images mentioned above. **Japanese Super CD-ROM v3.00 is recomended for maximum compatibility**. 
Additionally you can use a different bios for specific games (for example from Games Express) by placing cd_bios.rom inside the game image's folder.

## Save file
Some games support saves. Place an empty file with size 2048 bytes and name the same as ROM file with extension .sav
It will be automatically loaded with ROM.

## Cheat engine
Standard cheats location is supported for HuCard games. For CD-ROM game all cheats must be zipped into a single zip file and placed inside game's CD-ROM folder.

## Joystick
Both Turbotap and 6-button joysticks are supported.
Do not enable these features for games not supporting it, otherwise game will work incorrectly.

## Reset
Tap the Start + Select buttons together quickly to reset. The PC Engine/Turbografx-16 did not have a hardware reset button, and instead relies on this button combination.  The timing needs to be exact to trigger this, and sometimes it will take a couple tries.  With this method, in-game options will remain if you have changed them, whereas the MiSTer OSD reset will revert them.

## SDRAM
This core may work without SDRAM (using on-board DDR3), but it may have different kinds of issues/glitches due to high latency of DDR3 memory. Thus SDRAM module is highly recommended for maximum accuracy.

### Notes:
* Both headerless ROMs and ROMs with header (512b) are supported and automatically distinguished by file size.
